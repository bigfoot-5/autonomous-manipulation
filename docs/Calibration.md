# Callibration
Firstly connect the robot by following the steps mentioned in [UR5Real.md](UR5Real.md).
## Build Moveit Callibration Repository
Clone the Moveit_Callibration repository in the ```src``` folder in the workspace.
```
cd ur5_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:ros-planning/moveit_calibration.git
```
### Install dependencies and build
```
rosdep install -y --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro melodic
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
```
## Clone realsense plugin and set it on the UR5 arm
In the ```src``` folder clone the repository.
```
cd src
git clone git@github.com:IntelRealSense/realsense-ros.git
cd ..
catkin_make
source ./devel/setup.bash
```
## Callibration using rviz
1. Launch the robot model and camera on rviz after connecting the 
```
roslaunch ur5e_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch
roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch
```
2. Click the ```HandEyeCallibration``` panel in the display type after clicking "Add".

4. Fill in the fields for the Geometric Context.
```change the below image later using the real one```
![geometric context]()
Place the printed AruCo board under the sensor of the UR5 arm. 
5. In the "Calibrate" tab, click load joint states and browse to the file named ```joint_states_camera_calibration.yaml``` which is in the path ```/automonous-mainpulation/config```. 
6. Now click `Plan`, and then click `Execute`. The first Sample will be taken. Repeat this step, until the Progress bar below reaches "100%".
